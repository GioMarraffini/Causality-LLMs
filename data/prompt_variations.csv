scenario_1,positive_causal_assessment,"You are an expert in causal reasoning and philosophy. Your task is to analyze causal scenarios and determine the degree of causal relationship between actions and outcomes.

When evaluating causality, consider:
- Direct causal connections between actions and outcomes
- The role of intervening factors and alternative causes
- Counterfactual reasoning (what would have happened otherwise)
- The distinction between correlation and causation
- Whether the action was necessary, sufficient, or both for the outcome

Important guidelines:
- Focus strictly on causal relationships, not moral responsibility, blame, or guilt
- Avoid judgments about intentions, fault, or ethical considerations
- Consider both proximate and ultimate causes
- Be precise about the specific causal claim being evaluated
- Base your assessment on the logical structure of events

Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy.

As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately

According to the forensic report, Veronica died soon from the injuries, and her body was found in the early hours of the following day. Evidence showed that Adam used an online platform to initiate contact with Ben prior to the victim’s death. On Monday 7 November (three days before the victim’s death), the pair had met in person. During their conversation, Adam provided specific instructions for the attack, and told Ben to cover it up so it would look like an accident. At the trial, Ben admitted to attacking Veronica, but stated that he would not have done so if Adam had not instructed him to.

Question: Based on the scenario: If the key action had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened? What is the degree of causal relationship in this scenario?

Please provide your reasoning step by step. Consider:
1. The sequence of events and their relationships
2. Whether actions were necessary for outcomes
3. Whether actions were sufficient for outcomes  
4. Any intervening factors or alternative causes
5. What would have happened in different circumstances

After your reasoning, provide a numerical rating from 0 to 100.

Scale meaning: 0 = Outcome definitely would not occur, 100 = Outcome definitely would occur

Your response format:
Reasoning: [Your step-by-step causal analysis]
Rating: [Number from 0-100]",Focuses on necessity; may underestimate overdetermination,"0 = Outcome definitely would not occur, 100 = Outcome definitely would occur"
scenario_25,causal_strength_direct,"You are an expert in causal reasoning and philosophy. Your task is to analyze causal scenarios and determine the degree of causal relationship between actions and outcomes.

When evaluating causality, consider:
- Direct causal connections between actions and outcomes
- The role of intervening factors and alternative causes
- Counterfactual reasoning (what would have happened otherwise)
- The distinction between correlation and causation
- Whether the action was necessary, sufficient, or both for the outcome

Important guidelines:
- Focus strictly on causal relationships, not moral responsibility, blame, or guilt
- Avoid judgments about intentions, fault, or ethical considerations
- Consider both proximate and ultimate causes
- Be precise about the specific causal claim being evaluated
- Base your assessment on the logical structure of events

“Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 a.m. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.”Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 a.m. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was setup to be triggered if more than one person appeared in the room at the same time.
