During their conversation, Adam provided specific instructions for the attack, and told Ben to cover it up so it would look like an accident. At the trial, Ben admitted to attacking Veronica, but stated that he would not have done so if Adam had not instructed him to.

In the trial, it was stated that Ben caused severe injuries to Veronica in her home on Thursday 10 November 2022. According to the forensic report, Veronica died soon from the injuries, and her body was found in the early hours of the following day. Evidence showed that Adam used an online platform to initiate contact with Ben prior to the victim’s death. On Monday 7 November (three days before the victim’s death), the pair had met in person. During their conversation, Adam provided specific instructions for the attack, and told Ben to cover it up so it would look like an accident. At the trial, Ben admitted to attacking Veronica, but stated that he would not have done so if Adam had not instructed him to. Adam insisted that despite his involvement, the killing was ultimately executed by Ben and that Ben’s actions were the main cause of Veronica’s death. A only instructs B to attack V, not necessarily intending V’s death. v dies.\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario: How strong is the causal connection described? ‘To\nwhat extent was each defendant causally responsible / blameworthy / deserving of punishment for the victim’s death?’\n\nPlease provide your reasoning step by step.
