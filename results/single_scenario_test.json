    "scenario_text": "Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately",

Lauren logged on at 9:00 am as per the policy, and Jane also logged on at the same time, which led to the computer crashing.\n\n2. **Necessary Actions**: For the computer to crash, it was necessary for both Lauren and Jane to be logged on simultaneously. Jane's action of logging on at the same time as Lauren was necessary for the crash to occur.\n\n3. **Sufficient Actions**: Jane's action of logging on at 9:00 am, while disobeying the policy, was sufficient for the computer to crash because the policy was established to prevent simultaneous logins. Therefore, her action directly contributed to the outcome.\n\n4. **Intervening Factors or Alternative Causes**: The primary cause of the crash was the simultaneous login of both users. There are no intervening factors that would negate Jane's contribution to the crash. The computer's inherent limitation (not being able to handle multiple logins) is a constant factor in this scenario.\n\n5. **Counterfactual Reasoning**: If Jane had adhered to the policy and not logged on at 9:00 am, the computer would not have crashed. This indicates that her action was a direct cause of the outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, Jane's decision to log on at the same time as Lauren directly led to the computer crashing.
